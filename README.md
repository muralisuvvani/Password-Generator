#  PyPassword Generator

A simple and interactive Python project that generates a strong, secure password based on user-specified criteria like number of letters, symbols, and digits.

##  Features

- User-defined password length and complexity
- Randomized characters: letters, symbols, and numbers
- Shuffling of characters to enhance randomness
- Simple command-line interface

##  Requirements

- Python 3.x

##  How It Works

1. The program asks the user how many letters, symbols, and numbers they want.
2. It randomly selects characters from predefined lists.
3. It combines and shuffles them to generate a strong, unpredictable password.

## ▶️ Example Usage

```bash
Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!
How many letters would you like in your password?
> 6
How many symbols would you like?
> 2
How many numbers would you like?
> 3
your password is: aB#dE9!4G1
